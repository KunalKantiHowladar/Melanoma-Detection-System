📌 Overview:

MelanoScan is a deep learning-based melanoma detection system designed to assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of skin cancer.
It leverages image classification techniques using TensorFlow/Keras to predict whether a given skin lesion image indicates melanoma.
By integrating robust preprocessing and data augmentation, the model enhances accuracy and reduces overfitting on medical imaging data.

🚀 Features:

🖼 Image-based melanoma detection for early diagnosis
⚡ Deep Learning model using CNNs built with TensorFlow & Keras
🎨 Image preprocessing pipeline (resizing, normalization, and augmentation)
📊 Reliable performance on medical imaging datasets
🔍 Supports evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python 🐍
TensorFlow & Keras 🤖
NumPy & Pandas 📊
OpenCV 👁 for image processing
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈 for visualization

🎯 Usage:

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/melanoscan.git
cd melanoscan
pip install -r requirements.txt
